Overview
The  Problem
You work for a new startup that is trying to manufacture phones. You are tasked with building a model which will help determine how many machines to invest in and how much to spend on marketing. Each machine produces noutput phones per year. Each phone sells for $pphone and costs $cphone in variable costs to produce. After nlif e years, the machine can no longer produce output, but may be scrapped for $pscrap . The machine will not be replaced, so you may end up with zero total output before your model time period ends. Equity investment is limited, so in each year you can spend cmachine to either buy a machine or buy advertisements. In the ﬁrst year you must buy a machine. Any other machine purchases must be made one after another (advertising can only begin after machine buying is done). Demand for your phones starts at d1 . Each time you advertise, demand increases by gd %. The prevailing market interest rate is r.
Notes
•    You  may  limit  your  model  to  20  years  and  a  maximum  of  5  machines  if  it  is  helpful.
•    For  simplicity,  assume  that  cmachine    is  paid  in  every  year,  even  after  all  machines  have  shut  down.
•    Ensure  that  you  can  change  the  inputs  and  the  outputs  change  as  expected.
•    For  simplicity,  assume  that  fractional  phones  can  be  sold,  you  do  not  need  to  round  the  quantity  transacted.


The  Model
Inputs
•    noutput :   Number  of  phones  per  machine  per  year
•    nmachines :   Number  of  machines  purchased
•    nlif e :   Number  of  years  for  which  the  machine  produces  phones
•    pphone :   Price  per  phone
•    pscrap :   Scrap  value  of  machine
•    cmachine :   Price  per  machine  or  advertising  year
•    cphone :   Variable  cost  per  phone
•    d1 :   Quantity  of  phones  demanded  in  the  ﬁrst  year
•    gd :   Percentage  growth  in  demand  for  each  advertisement
•    r:   Interest  rate  earned  on  investments
